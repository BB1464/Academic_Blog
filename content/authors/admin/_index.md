# Biography

I am a data scientist, R developer, and agrometeorologist. I earned my Master degree in Agrometeorology from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria. My main research interests are related to Predictive modelling and Experimental Statistics. During the past few years, I discovered the power of the statistical programming language R. Since then I have turned into a big enthusiast, using the software almost every day for work and many private programming projects. I love analyzing data and making beautiful visualization with R. I have mentored countless students and scientists in everything from experimental design to using R for creating figures for their publication. I am also strongly committed to developing open-source packages to facilitate reproducible research. I devote a lot of my time to hosting local meetups to increase the popularity of R among users in Nigeria.
