I am a business scientist, R developer, and agrometeorologist. I earned my Master degree in Agrometeorology from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, under the supervision of Prof. K. O. Oluwasemire, Dr. Stefan Hauser, Dr. Moses Ogunlade and Mr. Deo Gratias Hougni. My research focuses on predictive modelling and agrometeorology. During the past few years, I discovered the power of the statistical programming language R. Since then I have turned into a big enthusiast, using the software almost every day for work and many private programming projects. I love analyzing data and making beautiful charts with R and I have mentored countless students and scientists in everything from experimental design to using R for creating figures for their publication. I am also strongly commited to develop open source software tools to facilitate reproducible research. I devote alot of my time to hosting local meetups to increase the popularity of R among users in Nigeria.
