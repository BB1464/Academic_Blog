**Oluwafemi Oyedele** is a data analyst and an R studio instructor. I earned my Master degree in Agrometeorology from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, under the supervision of Prof. K. O. Oluwasemire, Dr. Stefan Hauser, Dr. Moses Ogunlade and Mr. Deo Gratias Hougni. My research focuses on machine learning, soil fertility and agrometeorology, simulation modelling, plant breeding. During the past few years, I discovered the power of the statistical programming language R. Since then I have turned into a big enthusiast, using the software almost every day for work and many private programming projects. I love analyzing data and making beautiful charts with R and I have mentored countless students and scientists in everything from experimental design to using R for creating figures for their publication.
