abstract:  Infiltration of water into the soil is an important physical process affecting the fate of water under field conditions, especially the amount of subsurface recharge and surface runoff and hence the hazard  of  soil  erosion.  The  study  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  infiltration  models  of  soils developed  on  coastal  plain  sands  and  to  select  a  suitable  models  as  a  basis  to  improve  the management of the soil. A total of 16 infiltration runs were made with the double ring infiltrometer. For the purpose of getting best fitting model, the results obtained from various infiltration models were compared with observed field data. The parameters considered for best fitting of model were correlation coefficient  and  coefficient  of  variability  (CV).  Model-predicted cumulative  infiltration consistently  deviated  from  field-measured data,that  is,  the  models  under-predicted  cumulative infiltration  by several  orders  of  magnitude  for  Kostiakov,  Green  Ampt  and  Philip model  but  the model  over  predicted  cumulative  infiltration  for Horton  model.  The  results  of  the  soil  samples analysed revealed that the mean values of 707.50, 208.13 and 84.38 gkg-1 for sand, silt and clay with the textural class of sandy loam. The bulk density, particle density and total porosity had mean values  of  1.84  gcm-3,  2.44  gcm-3  and 22.56%.  However,  there  was  a  fairly  good  agreement between mean-measured cumulative infiltration (7.30 cm/hr, CV = 32.19%); Philips (1.93 cm/hr, CV = 42.49%); Kostiakov  (0.13  cm/hr, CV = 30.77%); Horton (64.49  cm/hr,  CV = 22.39%)  and Green Ampt model (42.04 cm/hr, CV = 0.57%) respectively. The data however showed that the correlation coefficient for Kostiakov (1.00) was best fitting in predicting the field measured data and this was closely followed by Green Ampt (0.88); while Philipâ€™s model and Horton model showed a negative correlation (r = -0.88 and r = -0.82) with the field measured data. Conservation measures involving  mulching,  cover  cropping  and  afforestation  are  recommended  to  improve  the  soil structure and infiltration capacity.
