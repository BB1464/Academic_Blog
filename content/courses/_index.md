I am an Rstudio Instructor in the tidyverse, and I love teaching people on how to use R to analyze data. These courses are hands-on, using clear, engaging projects. While my approach is particularly geared towards biological scientists, you will learn best practices relevant to all aspects of data science. My course materials are also intentionally modular; if the contents of any course don't fit your exact needs, we can easily re-arrange them to better suit your team! In preparation for the upcoming course, I want to help you blast through the first obstacle in learning R quickly and effectively. There is this common idea that R has a difficult learning curve. However, I am going to challenge this belief by showing you that it is possible to become confident with R in a relatively short period of time. It doesn't need to take years and expensive university courses to feel comfortable working with R. I create courses based on what I wish I had when I started as a graduate student at the University of Ibadan, and I am excited to share them with you. Don't let the R learning curve stand in the way of doing good science. Learning R can be faster, more fun, and easier than you thought. Let me show you how. Please fill free to reach out if you are insterested in having me lead a workshop or training for you!
